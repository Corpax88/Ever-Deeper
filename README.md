# Ever Deeper

The current game is a **Godot 4.7.2** project. Open `project.godot` in this directory.
The game version is defined in `project.godot` (currently 0.46.9).
This source cleanup preserves the published game's gameplay, artwork, balance and save format.

## Start here

- [Code map](docs/code-map.md): where to make each kind of change.
- [Verification](docs/verification.md): current checks, mobile review and known older failures.
- [Project rules](AGENTS.md): approved art and the mandatory visual release gate.
- [Cleanup review](docs/cleanup-review.md): independent scores, changes and remaining debt.

## Run and check

Install the standard Godot **4.7.2** editor. From this directory:

```sh
godot --editor --path .
python3 tools/qa.py --godot /path/to/Godot
python3 tools/check_invariants.py
```

`GODOT_BIN` can supply the executable instead of `--godot`.
The QA launcher isolates test save files, checks exit codes and completion markers,
and fails on runtime errors or timeouts. Its default is the current source suite;
older failing checks remain available explicitly, with their failures documented.

## Web builds

Install matching Godot 4.7.2 export templates, create the output directories, then:

```sh
godot --headless --path . --export-release 'Web DEV' builds/dev/index.html
godot --headless --path . --export-release 'Web Production' builds/live/index.html
python3 tools/qa.py --godot /path/to/Godot --pack builds/live/index.pck --cases build-flavor
```

DEV retains its developer menu and isolated saves. Production excludes the developer-menu
resource. Publishing is a separate, reviewed step; exporting or changing source does not
publish a build. The historical release workflows under `.github/` record prior releases.

Older JavaScript-prototype instructions are historical, not instructions for this game.
No source archive or chain of release patches is needed to open this complete project.
